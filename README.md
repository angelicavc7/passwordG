<passwordG>

## Description
the project required you to generate a form that created a password using the following characteristics
-uppercase letters
-lowercase letters
-symbols
-numbers
-length from 8 to 128 characters

*you were required to create all those variables including the variables which called the commands in order for the user to be able to click and decide which characteristics where needed
*the assignment had to be formatted in a specific way where the user could answer and type how they wanted to format their password
*you had to include a repeat command that called forth the function and be able to use if/else statements to create each of the commands in order for them to be present in the question bar 


I gained a lot of understanding from this project itself, but i was not able to complete the task. I lack understanding of functions and forloops. I did not struggle making the variables, although it did take me awhile to create boolean statements that placed the variables that needed to be confirmed by the reader.
I believe that my if statements where close but that they lacked format and I did not understand what I actually was trying to place on the webpage.
it took me awhile to understand how to format the html document and to understand that the generate password button was being pulled from the html document. 
this was definitely something that im really struggling with, and I realized how much more time i need to really focus on what im learning and how to adapt it to different situations like this one.

I plan on being able to complete this assignment on my own by the end of this weekend and hopefully gain a better understanding of java

## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
1. Create variables, which are supposed to be arrays
2. Create confirm/prompts that enabled true/false statements in order for the user to be able to choose the format of the password
3. create randomized set for each of the variables in order to create and generate pasword with random characters
4. Check to see what the user confirmed in order to be able to apply it to the new password
5. When creating final password variable dont forget to add random variable of each characteristic in order for it to be able to return
6. Create a variable where password can be created and presented on the webpage
7. Create a variable where the password generator can be returned
